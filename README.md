# Website Traffic Forecasting

A machine learning-based web application that predicts future website traffic using historical data. This project helps businesses, marketers, and website owners forecast visitor counts, page views, and other relevant metrics to plan for high or low traffic periods effectively.

## Features

- **Historical Data Analysis**: Analyzes website traffic data over time to identify trends and patterns.
- **Traffic Forecasting**: Uses machine learning models (e.g., ARIMA, LSTM) to predict future traffic.
- **Seasonal Trends**: Takes into account holidays, events, and marketing campaigns for more accurate predictions.
- **Data Visualization**: Displays forecast results using graphs and charts for easy interpretation.
- **Performance Metrics**: Evaluates the model accuracy using MAE, RMSE, and other statistical metrics.

## Technologies Used

- **Programming Languages**: Python
- **Libraries**: 
  - Pandas, Numpy (Data processing and manipulation)
  - Scikit-learn (Machine learning models)
  - TensorFlow, Keras (Deep learning models for time-series forecasting)
  - Matplotlib, Seaborn (Data visualization)
- **Data Sources**: Google Analytics API, CSV files, web scraping
- **Web Framework** (Optional): Flask/Django (for web app integration)
- **Database** (Optional): MySQL/PostgreSQL (for storing traffic data)
